# How to run this Python Machine Learning project locally to build the Facial Expression Prediction Model
1. Install conda-forge/miniforge for fresh Python version
2. Install Machine Learning Libraries (numpy, pandas, tensorflow, matplotlib) with the Python Virtual Environment activated (e.g. conda install numpy)
3. Install Visual Studio Code (IDE for easier view of the code)
4. Update the FacialExpressionModel.py file in this application folder by replacing
 ***** with your directory name (where the test and train images are stored)
5. Within the root directory of this application:
run the following command on the terminal:
python FacialExpressionModel.py
OR run using the Visual Studio IDE
